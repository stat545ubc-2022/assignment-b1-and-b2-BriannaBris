# Name of Function
- choose something clever like K8 and MC, and briefly describe what the function does

```{r}
# Load libraries required to run function
```

# Inputs
- describe what each variable is, what classes of variables can be used 
- na.rm = remove NA's before running the function. Set default to my choosing and then use `...` so users of function have the flexibility to change if required for their dataset

# Outputs
- explain what the number(s) that come out after running my function represent
- potentially helpful to include a `print` statement to explain this directly
- include an error message in the above function for when class rules are not obeyed, clearly explaining why the function failed -> if() stop() or see other options from WS#B1

```{r}
# This is where my function's code will go
```

# Testing my function
- use `testthat()` to see if function returns equivalent results to when you type out the entire statement or that the value returned matches -> including this in function code is a convenient way to check all values that you input are acceptable and that the function isn't running any errors
- attack your function by putting in variable classes that you know won't work or comparing to equations/values that are not equivalent to the values plugged into the function -> use expect_() 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
